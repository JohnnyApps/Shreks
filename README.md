# Shreks
This is an app for iOS that lets you convert minutes and hours to Shreks :)
v. 3.0.1

This app was created ONLY for fun. I put a lot of work into it, but it was worth it :p

To be clear: 1 Shrek = 1 hour and 35 minutes, because this is the length of the Shrek 1 movie.

Shreks is full of great surprises. You can swipe from left side of the screen to enable something *this is a surprise :D* 
You can also type in date when the first shrek movie was relased in format DDMMYY and see what happens.

I'm constantly upgrading the app and making it work on all devices, right now the app is fully optimised for all iPhone Plus models.
On other devices i had problems with layout and i'm still trying to figure it out.

Of course if you have any ideas what I should add to Shreks, write a comment :)) 
Also tell me if you like the app or nah
